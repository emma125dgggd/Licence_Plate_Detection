**License Plate Recognition System**

This License Plate Recognition (LPR) system is an advanced, efficient, and accessible solution designed to automate the process of detecting and reading vehicle license plates. Utilizing state-of-the-art object detection and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technologies, our system provides a seamless experience for users looking to integrate LPR capabilities into their projects. Whether for parking management, traffic control, security systems, or toll collection, our LPR system offers unparalleled accuracy and speed.

**Features**
Automatic License Plate Detection: Our system can detect license plates in various conditions and angles, thanks to our robust object detection algorithms.
High Precision OCR: Once detected, the license plate's text is extracted with high precision OCR, ensuring accurate readings even under challenging conditions.

Real-Time Processing: Designed for efficiency, our system processes images and video streams in real-time, providing immediate results.
Wide Range Support: Supports a wide range of license plate formats from different countries and regions.

Easy Integration: Comes with a straightforward API and documentation, making it easy to integrate into existing systems.

Scalable: Whether you're handling a small number of requests or scaling up to millions, our system is designed to scale seamlessly with your needs.
